Or a slightly chilly welcome, since autumn begins next week.\r\nDo you ever stop and think about supervolcanoes? I had a long conversation with my boss about the Yellowstone volcano the other day. Apparently we're long overdue. So that's just something to think about. I hope we make it to the first day of autumn, at least.\r\nBut if not, isn't the end of summer a lovely way to spend your last days? August and September are so long, drowsy, and kind of bittersweet. It's definitely the time of year where the afternoons are quiet, a little too quiet maybe, and your mind wanders just a bit too much.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Feeling igneous today","date":"09/18/2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/grace-post/"}},
