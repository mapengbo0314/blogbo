## Well, another weeek has come and gone. Next week is the first day of fall. Time is just slipping through our fingers, isn't it?
Hello and welcome back, and for all of you newcomers, allow me to extend a warm welcome to you. Or a slightly chilly welcome, since autumn begins next week.
Do you ever stop and think about supervolcanoes? I had a long conversation with my boss about the Yellowstone volcano the other day. Apparently we're long overdue. So that's just something to think about. I hope we make it to the first day of autumn, at least. 
But if not, isn't the end of summer a lovely way to spend your last days? August and September are so long, drowsy, and kind of bittersweet. It's definitely the time of year where the afternoons are quiet, a little too quiet maybe, and your mind wanders just a bit too much.
